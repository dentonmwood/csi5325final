	abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

The goal of the present research was to obtain a deeper understanding concerning the motivations underlying Pokémon Go use and to create a measure that assesses these motivations. By extending the framework of the Motives for Online Gaming Questionnaire, three new factors – Outdoor Activity, Nostalgia, and Boredom – were added based on the findings of qualitative analysis, and which led to the creation of the Motives for Online Gaming Questionnaire - Pokémon Go extension (MOGQ-PG). Confirmatory factor analysis was carried out on a sample of Pokémon Go players (N=621). Results demonstrated that the final 37-item, first-order, 10-factor model had appropriate factor structure and internal consistency. A second follow-up study on Pokémon Go players (N=510) examined associations between gaming motivations, problematic use, and impulsivity. Results demonstrated that impulsivity was not related to the MOGQ-PG motives. Results also showed that competition and fantasy motivations predicted problematic gaming behavior. The present research is the first empirical contribution to the assessment and understanding of the motivational background of playing AR games such as Pokémon Go.},

The authors identify three value drivers (price promotion, location, and personalization) and examine their effect on customers' purchase intention. The influence of the three value drivers was tested in a large-scale representative study with a laboratory experimental design. The findings indicate that all three value drivers increase purchase intention. Surprisingly, the authors find that price promotions are the least important value driver, whereas the location of receiving a mobile ad is the strongest driver of purchase intention. An interaction effect between location and personalization was also found to be significant. Personalization close to the product has little impact on purchase intention. The findings have important implications for researchers and retail managers, particularly when designing mobile in-store advertising campaigns.},

	abstract = {Indoor localization has attracted more and more attention because of its importance in many applications. One of the most popular techniques for indoor localization is the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) based fingerprinting approach. Since RSSI values are very complicated and noisy, conventional machine learning algorithms often suffer from limited performance. Recently developed deep learning algorithms have been shown to be powerful for the analysis of complex data. In this paper, we propose a local feature-based deep long short-term memory (LF-DLSTM) approach for WiFi fingerprinting indoor localization. The local feature extractor attempts to reduce the noise effect and extract robust local features. The DLSTM network is able to encode temporal dependencies and learn high-level representations for the extracted sequential local features. Real experiments have been conducted in two different environments, i.e., a research lab and an office. We also compare the proposed approach with some state-of-the-art methods for indoor localization. The results show that the proposed approach achieves the best localization performance with mean localization errors of 1.48 and 1.75 m under the research lab and office environments, respectively. The improvements of our proposed approach over the state-of-the-art methods range from 18.98\% to 53.46\%.},

	abstract = {The number of studies on the development of indoor positioning systems has increased recently due to the growing demands of the various location-based services. Inertial sensors available in commercial smartphones play an important role in indoor localization and navigation owing to their highly accurate localization performance. In this study, the inertial sensors of a smartphone, which generate distinct patterns for physical activities and action units (AUs), are employed to localize a target in an indoor environment. These AUs, (such as a left turn, right turn, normal step, short step, or long step), help to accurately estimate the indoor location of a target. By taking advantage of sophisticated deep learning algorithms, we propose a novel approach for indoor navigation based on long short-term memory (LSTM). The LSTM accurately recognizes physical activities and related AUs by automatically extracting the efficient features from the distinct patterns of the input data. Experiment results show that LSTM provides a significant improvement in the indoor positioning performance through the recognition task. The proposed system achieves a better localization performance than the trivial fingerprinting method, with an average error of 0.782 m in an indoor area of 128.6 m2. Additionally, the proposed system exhibited robust performance by excluding the abnormal activity from the pedestrian activities.},

	abstract = {The Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) suffer from accuracy deterioration and outages in dense urban canyons and are almost unavailable for indoor environments. Nowadays, developing indoor positioning systems has become an attractive research topic due to the increasing demands on ubiquitous positioning. WiFi technology has been studied for many years to provide indoor positioning services. The WiFi indoor localization systems based on machine learning approach are widely used in the literature. These systems attempt to find the perfect match between the user fingerprint and pre-defined set of grid points on the radio map. However, Fingerprints are duplicated from available Access Points (APs) and interference, which increase number of matched patterns with the user's fingerprint. In this research, the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is utilized to improve the performance and to reduce the computation cost of the WiFi indoor localization systems based on machine learning approach. All proposed methods were developed and physically realized on Android-based smart phone using the IEEE 802.11 WLANs. The experimental setup was conducted in a real indoor environment in both static and dynamic modes. The performance of the proposed method was tested using K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers. The results show that the performance of the proposed method outperforms other indoor localization reported in the literature. The computation time was reduced by 70\% when using Random Forest classifier in the static mode and by 33\% when using KNN in the dynamic mode.},
